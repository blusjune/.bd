Register % contains the name of the current file,
and register # contains the name of the alternate file.
These registers allow the name of the current or alternate files
to be displayed or inserted.

The name, or full path, or directory containing the file can be used.
For example, in directory /abc
the command vim def/my.txt would edit file /abc/def/my.txt.

The following commands could be entered to display the information shown.

:echo @% 		def/my.txt		directory/name of file
:echo expand('%:t') 	my.txt	 		name of file ('tail')
:echo expand('%:p') 	/abc/def/my.txt		full path
:echo expand('%:p:h')	/abc/def		directory containing file ('head')

If all that is wanted is to display the name of the current file,
type Ctrl-G (or press 1 then Ctrl-G for the full path).

When using @%, the name is displayed relative to the current directory.

In insert mode,
type Ctrl-R then % to insert the name of the current file.

In command mode (after typing a colon),
type Ctrl-R then % to insert the name of the current file.
The inserted name can then be edited to create a similar name.

In normal mode,
type "%p to put the name of the current file after the cursor
(or "%P to insert the name before the cursor).

The following commands insert lines
consisting of the full path of the current and alternate files into the buffer:

:put =expand('%:p')
:put =expand('#:p')
