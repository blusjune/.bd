=== SAN connection ===

* iSCSI uses TCP (usually TCP ports 860 and 3260).
* iSCSI simply allows two hosts to negotiate and then exchange SCSI commands using IP networks.
* Unlike some SAN protocols, iSCSI requires no dedicated cabling; as a result, iSCSI is often seen as a low-cost alternative to Fibre Channel, which requires dedicated infrastructure except in its FCoE (Fibre Channel over Ehternet) form.
* However, the performance of an iSCSI SAN deployment can be severely degraded if not operated on a dedicated network or subnet.
