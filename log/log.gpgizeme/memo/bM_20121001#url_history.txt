=== String metric / similarity ===

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_metric
: String metric
: In mathematics and computer science, a string metric (also known as a string similarity metric or string distance function) is a metric that measures similarity or dissimilarity (distance) between two text strings for approximate string matching or comparison and in fuzzy string searching.
: A string metric provides a number indicating an algorithm-specific indication of similarity.

=== n-gram ===

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram
: n-gram
: In the fields of computational linguistics and probability, an n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sequence of text or speech. 
: An n-gram of size 1 is referred to as a "unigram"; size 2 is a "bigram" (or, less commonly, a "digram"); size 3 is a "trigram". Larger sizes are sometimes referred to by the value of n, e.g., "four-gram", "five-gram", and so on.

=== Distributed File System ===

* http://www.openafs.org/
: OpenAFS
: AFS is a distributed filesystem product, pioneered at Carnegie Mellon University and supported and developed as a product by Transarc Corporation (now IBM Pittsburgh Labs). It offers a client-server architecture for federated file sharing and replicated read-only content distribution, providing location independence, scalability, security, and transparent migration capabilities. AFS is available for a broad range of heterogeneous systems including UNIX, Linux,  MacOS X, and Microsoft Windows
: IBM branched the source of the AFS product, and made a copy of the source available for community development and maintenance. They called the release OpenAFS.
