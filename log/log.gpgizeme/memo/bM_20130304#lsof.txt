=== command arguments of lsof ===

By default One file per line is displayed. Most of the columns are self explanatory. We will explain the details about couple of cryptic columns (FD and TYPE).

FD - Represents the file descriptor. Some of the values of FDs are,

:* cwd : Current Working Directory
:* txt : Text file
:* mem : Memory mapped file
:* mmap : Memory mapped device
:* NUMBER : Represent the actual file descriptor. The character after the number i.e '1u', represents the mode in which the file is opened. r for read, w for write, u for read and write.
