# Do some important numbers on SSD drives, to gauge what kind of
# performance you might get out of them.
#
# Sequential read and write speeds are tested, these are expected to be
# high. Random reads should also be fast, random writes are where crap
# drives are usually separated from the good drives.
#
# This uses a queue depth of 4. New SATA SSD's will support up to 32
# in flight commands, so it may also be interesting to increase the queue
# depth and compare. Note that most real-life usage will not see that
# large of a queue depth, so 4 is more representative of normal use.
